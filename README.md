# Multi-Agent Data Analysis System

An intelligent data analysis system powered by LangGraph and OpenAI that automatically orchestrates multiple specialized agents to provide comprehensive business insights.

## 🌟 Features

- **Dynamic Workflows**: Automatically designs optimal workflow based on user query
- **Optimization Loops**: Self-optimizing with continuous quality improvements
- **Error Handling & Recovery**: Graceful failure handling with retry logic
- **Business Ready**: Generates executive-level insights and recommendations
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new agents and capabilities
- **Multiple Interfaces**: CLI, Python API, and Streamlit web UI

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of specialized agents orchestrated by LangGraph:

### Core Agents
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Plans optimal workflow based on user query
- **Data Acquisition Agent**: Loads and validates datasets
- **Data Query Agent**: Generates and executes data queries
- **EDA Agent**: Performs exploratory data analysis
- **Recommendation Agent**: Builds recommendation systems
- **Clustering Agent**: Performs segmentation and pattern discovery
- **NLP Agent**: Processes text data for insights
- **Optimization Agent**: Reviews and improves analytical outputs
- **Business Insight Agent**: Translates findings into business strategies
- **Visualization Agent**: Creates compelling visualizations
- **Debugger Agent**: Handles errors and implements retry logic

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Usage

#### Streamlit Web UI

```bash
# Launch Streamlit app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Then open browser to `http://localhost:8501`

## 💡 Example Queries

- "How many customers are there by state?"
- "What product categories have the highest review scores?"
- "What categories are frequently bought together with health_beauty?"
- "Show customer distribution by city"
- "Perform clustering analysis on customer segments"
- "What are the sentiment patterns in customer reviews?"

## 🔧 Configuration

### config.py

Main configuration file containing:
- API keys and model settings
- Agent descriptions
- System parameters (max optimization cycles, retry attempts)
- File patterns for data discovery

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `DATA_PATH`: Path to your dataset directory

## 📊 Supported Data Formats

- CSV (.csv)
- Parquet (.parquet)
- Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
- JSON (.json)

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Agents

1. Create new agent module in `agents/` directory
2. Import in `agents/__init__.py`
3. Add to `AGENT_MAPPINGS` in `graph.py`
4. Update `AGENT_DESCRIPTIONS` in `config.py`


### Modifying Workflows

Edit the orchestrator prompt in `agents/orchestrator.py` to customize how workflows are planned.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run with a simple query
python main.py "Show me the data overview"

# Run with complex analysis
python main.py "Perform customer segmentation and provide business insights"
```

## 📝 Development

The codebase follows a modular, functional approach:
- Each agent is a standalone function
- State is passed between agents via `AgentState` TypedDict
- No class-based architecture (easy to modify individual functions)
- Clear separation of concerns
